## Cloud Provider Specific Guidelines

### AWS Guidelines
The AWS folder contains standards specific to Amazon Web Services:

- **Project Structure**: AWS account organization, resource naming conventions, and service integration patterns
- **Security Practices**: IAM roles, KMS encryption, VPC security, AWS Secrets Manager integration
- **State Management**: S3 backend with DynamoDB locking, cross-account access, and monitoring

Key AWS features covered:
- AWS Organizations integration
- Cross-account IAM roles
- S3 and DynamoDB for state management
- AWS Config and CloudTrail for compliance
- KMS encryption and AWS Secrets Manager

### Azure Guidelines
The Azure folder contains standards specific to Microsoft Azure:

- **Project Structure**: Azure subscription organization, resource naming conventions, and service integration patterns
- **Security Practices**: Azure AD integration, Key Vault, managed identities, and network security
- **State Management**: Azure Storage backend with blob versioning and private endpoints

Key Azure features covered:
- Azure AD and RBAC integration
- Managed identities and service principals
- Azure Storage for state management
- Azure Policy and Azure Monitor
- Customer-managed keys and Key Vault

## General Guidelines

### Variable Conventions
- Naming standards and patterns
- Type definitions and validation
- Documentation requirements
- Environment-specific configurations

### Testing Strategies
- Unit testing with Terratest
- Static analysis with tfsec, Checkov, and TFLint
- Integration testing patterns
- CI/CD pipeline integration

### Performance Optimization
- State file organization
- Resource creation optimization
- Module design patterns
- Large-scale deployment strategies

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your cloud provider** - Navigate to the appropriate folder (aws/ or azure/)
2. **Review project structure** - Start with the project-structure.md file for your provider
3. **Implement security practices** - Follow the security-practices.md guidelines
4. **Configure state management** - Set up remote state using the state-management.md guide
5. **Apply general best practices** - Use the root-level files for variable conventions, testing, and performance

## Provider-Specific Features

### AWS-Specific Patterns
```hcl
# AWS provider with default tags
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
  
  default_tags {
    tags = {
      Environment = var.environment
      Project     = var.project_name
      ManagedBy   = "terraform"
    }
  }
}

# S3 backend configuration
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "aws/environments/prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-locks"
  }
}
```

### Azure-Specific Patterns
```hcl
# Azure provider with features block
provider "azurerm" {
  features {
    resource_group {
      prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources = false
    }
    key_vault {
      purge_soft_delete_on_destroy = true
    }
  }
}

# Azure Storage backend configuration
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "rg-terraform-state"
    storage_account_name = "sttfstate"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "azure/environments/prod/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

## Key Differences Between Providers

| Aspect | AWS | Azure |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **State Storage** | S3 + DynamoDB | Azure Storage Account |
| **Identity Management** | IAM Roles | Azure AD + Managed Identities |
| **Secrets Management** | AWS Secrets Manager | Azure Key Vault |
| **Encryption** | KMS | Customer-Managed Keys |
| **Network Security** | Security Groups + NACLs | Network Security Groups |
| **Monitoring** | CloudWatch + CloudTrail | Azure Monitor + Log Analytics |
| **Compliance** | AWS Config | Azure Policy |

## Best Practices Summary

### Universal Principles
- Use remote state storage with locking
- Implement least privilege access
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper tagging strategies
- Monitor and audit infrastructure changes
- Test infrastructure code
- Document configurations and dependencies

### Provider Selection
- **Choose AWS** for: Mature ecosystem, extensive service catalog, strong enterprise features
- **Choose Azure** for: Microsoft ecosystem integration, hybrid cloud scenarios, enterprise AD integration
- **Multi-cloud**: Use consistent patterns but leverage provider-specific strengths

## Contributing

When adding new guidelines:
1. Place provider-specific content in the appropriate folder (aws/ or azure/)
2. Use provider-specific resource names and configurations
3. Include current provider versions and features
4. Test examples with the latest provider versions
5. Update this README with any new sections or patterns

## Version Information

These guidelines are current as of:
- **AWS Provider**: v6.8.0
- **Azure Provider**: v4.39.0
- **Terraform**: v1.5+

Regular updates ensure compatibility with the latest provider features and best practices.
